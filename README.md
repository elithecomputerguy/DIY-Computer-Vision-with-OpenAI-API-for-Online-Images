DIY: Computer Vision with OpenAI API for Online Images

These 2 projects show you how to use the OpenAI Vision API to provide information about images on the web.  You provide a public URL to the image and your query.  You can ask for appropriate tags, a caption, a description or suc and OpenAI provides a detailed response.

The vision project is simply a web form that displays a response from OpenAI.

The vision-sql project stores the responses into a SQLite database and shows your previous images, queries and responses on the index page.
